These are two simple macros that you can use to quickly get general dice pools for both mortals and kindred, its all very customizable as well.

To use so far I have only gotten them working for foundry VTT as that is what I use for my games though if you can figure out how to run them locally you may not need it but I personally will not 
be assisting with that at this time.

Use Instructions:
1. download the files as a ZIP
2. Open up a foundry VTT world. (this may require you to create one if you haven't please access their own tutorials if you need assistance with that)
3. once loaded in left click on the Macro/Action bar. (similar to what you would see in a videogame like World of warcraft)
4. Name the Macro something appropriate. (or not I'm not your Mum)
5. Change the type to script with the drop down.
6. Copy and paste in the entirety of one of the scripts.
7. Hit save
8. Congrats you may now hit the hotkey of the Macro or Click it on your screen to use it.
